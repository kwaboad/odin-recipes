    <p>I love Chef John's tuna-noodle-casserole. It is very sumptious and delicious to taste. It is good for a family get together.
        I make it for my family on every Thanksgiving holiday. It is usually the first to
        finish on the dining table. Everybody loves it.

        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups cold milk</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 (5.5 ounce) can tuna packed in olive oil drained and crumbled to taste</li>
        <li>3.4 cup frozen peas, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne peper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly butter a 9x13-inch casserole 
            dish.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute onion 
            with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt until it starts to soften up and turn translucent, 
            3 to 4 minutes. Add the flour, and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes, reducing heat if 
            needed.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in cold milk and whisk for 1 minute. Raise heat to medium-high and cook, 
            stirring often, until the sauce thickens and comes to a simmer. Remove from heat, 
            whisk in Cheddar cheese, and reserve until needed.
        </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and remaining salt and bring to a rapid boil. Cook egg 
            noodles for 5 minutes. Drain well and add to a large mixing bowl. Stir in the reserved sauce, 
            followed by tuna, peas, cayenne, black pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix with a 
            spatula until evenly combined.
        </li>
        <li>Pour mixture into the prepared dish. Mix bread crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, 
            and olive oil together in a small bowl until combined and resembling wet sand. Sprinkle evenly over the casserole.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until browned and bubbly, about 30 minutes. 
            Let sit for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
