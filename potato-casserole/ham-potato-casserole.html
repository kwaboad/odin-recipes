    <p>This ham, potato and broccoli combination is not only delightful in the eyes
        but very sumptious and delicious to taste. It is good for a family get together.
        I make it for my family on every Thanksgiving holiday. It is usually the first to
        finish on the dining table. Everybody loves it.
